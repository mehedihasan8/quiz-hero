        <h2>Difference map(), forEach(), filter() and find()</h2>
        <h4>
          map, forEach, filter and find This is the array method. they each have
          a different purpose and can be used
        </h4>
        <p class="line">
          1. The function of map is to return each element by throwing a loop
          with array.<br />
          2. The forEach function throws a loop but does not return anything.<br />
          3. find function that work find the first element that meets a
          condition.<br />
          4. filter function select all element that meets a condition and
          return with array.

        <h2>Difference cookies, local storage and session storage</h2>
        <h4>
          Cookies, Session Storage, and Local Storage are all ways to store data
          in a user's browser, but they have different characteristics and use
          cases:
        </h4>
        <p class="line">
          1. <span class="span">Cookies</span>: Cookies are small text files
          that are stored on the client-side by the browser. They are commonly
          used to store user preferences, session IDs, and other small amounts
          of data.<br />
          2. <span class="span">Session Storage</span>: Session Storage is a
          mechanism for storing key-value pairs in the browser, similar to local
          storage. However, Session Storage is only available for the duration
          of a user's session on a website. Once the user closes the browser,
          the data stored in Session Storage is deleted.<br />
          3. <span class="span">Local Storage</span>: Local Storage is another
          mechanism for storing key-value pairs in the browser, Some like that
          Session Storage, but Local Storage persists even after the user closes
          the browser. Local Storage is often used to store user preferences,
          caching data, or other data that needs to be accessed across multiple
          sessions. However, Local Storage has a maximum size limit that varies
          depending on the browser.

        <h2>How does the Event Loop work?</h2>
        <h4>
          The event loop is a mechanism that continuously checks the JavaScript
          execution stack and the task queue to determine what code needs to be
          executed next. Here's how it works
        </h4>
        <p class="line">
          1. JavaScript has a single thread of execution, which means that it
          can only do one thing at a time. When a function is called, it gets
          added to the call stack, which is a data structure that keeps track of
          where the program is in its execution. <br />

          2. When an asynchronous operation, such as a setTimeout or an HTTP
          request, is called, it gets added to the task queue, which is a data
          structure that holds tasks that are waiting to be executed. <br />

          3.Once the call stack is empty, the event loop checks the task queue
          to see if there are any tasks waiting to be executed. If there is a
          task in the queue, the event loop moves it from the task queue to the
          call stack, and the function associated with the task is executed.
          <br />

          4. As the function is executing, any synchronous code in the function
          gets added to the call stack. When the function finishes executing,
          the call stack is empty again, and the event loop checks the task
          queue for the next task.
          <br />
          5. This process continues until there are no more tasks in the task
          queue, at which point the event loop stops checking for tasks and the
          program ends.

          Here are explaining how the
          <span class="heilight">quizTimer()</span> function works in JavaScript

        <p class="line">
          # At first the quizTimer function is to check the dismiss parameter.
          If dismiss is true, then the clearInterval function is called with the
          timer variable to stop the timer. If dismiss is not true, the timer
          continues to run. and the function creates a new timer using the
          setInterval function. <br />

          # Then going to Inside the interval function, the current count of
          seconds is obtained using a variable called count. The count is then
          converted into minutes and seconds format using the Math.floor and
          modulus (%) operators. The minutes and seconds are then displayed on
          the web page using the innerHTML property. <br />

          # Finally the count variable is incremented by one every time the
