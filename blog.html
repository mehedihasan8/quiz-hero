        <h2>Difference cookies, local storage and session storage</h2>
        <p class="line">
          Cookies, Session Storage, and Local Storage are all ways to store data
          in a user's browser, but they have different characteristics and use
          cases: <br />

          1. <span class="span">Cookies</span>: Cookies are small text files
          that are stored on the client-side by the browser. They are commonly
          used to store user preferences, session IDs, and other small amounts
          of data.<br />
          2. <span class="span">Session Storage</span>: Session Storage is a
          mechanism for storing key-value pairs in the browser, similar to local
          storage. However, Session Storage is only available for the duration
          of a user's session on a website. Once the user closes the browser,
          the data stored in Session Storage is deleted.<br />
          3. <span class="span">Local Storage</span>: Local Storage is another
          mechanism for storing key-value pairs in the browser, Some like that
          Session Storage, but Local Storage persists even after the user closes
          the browser. Local Storage is often used to store user preferences,
          caching data, or other data that needs to be accessed across multiple
          sessions. However, Local Storage has a maximum size limit that varies
          depending on the browser.
